# Project
# E-commerce Order Analysis
• Conducted comprehensive analyses of order patterns, shipping performance, and cancellation trends using Python, pandas, and Matplotlib.
• Delivered actionable insights to optimize operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve shipping strategies.
• Interactive dashboards were put in place to display important metrics, sales promotions, order cancellations, average order value (AOV), and regional sales trends. This allowed stakeholders in the e-commerce industry to make data-driven decisions.
# SBA Loan Data Analysis & Default Prediction
• Analyzed 432K+ SBA loan records (1987–2014) to identify lending trends and default risks.
• Used Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data cleaning; applied Random Forest & Gradient Boosting to predict defaults.
• Evaluated models with accuracy, precision, and recall, mapped loan distribution via geospatial visualizations.
• Delivered insights to improve SBA loan policies and risk assessment strategies.
# Housing Price Prediction—Ames, Iowa
• Built ML models to predict housing prices using EDA, feature engineering, and regression techniques.
• Cleaned and encoded data, imputed missing values, and evaluated models using RMSE & R².
• Visualized key trends using Matplotlib & Seaborn; provided insights for real estate decisions.
# Car Specifications Analysis & Modeling
• Analyzed vehicle data (1945–2020) to uncover trends in specs, fuel types, and efficiency.
• Cleaned and transformed data; conducted EDA with Matplotlib & Seaborn.
• Generated insights for manufacturers and policymakers to support design and regulatory decisions.
